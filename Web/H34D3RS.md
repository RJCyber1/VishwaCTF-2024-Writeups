Another stolen challenge: https://github.com/daffainfo/ctf-writeup/tree/main/2023/WxMCTF%202023/WxMCTF%20Web%202%20-%20Restricted%20Access

The flag is the exact same as the challenge they stole from, but with the VishwaCTF flag format.

I think OSINTing the stolen challenge was way more valuable than wasting my time on these challenges :P
